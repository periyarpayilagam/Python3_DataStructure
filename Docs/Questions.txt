What are dynamically typed languages?
	
	A programming language is said to be dynamically typed, or just 'dynamic', 
	when the majority of its type checking is performed at run-time as opposed 
	to at compile-time. In dynamic typing, types are associated with values not variables.
	
Why python is interpreted?

	py source code is first compiled to byte code as .pyc. This byte code can be 
	interpreted (official CPython), or JIT compiled (PyPy). Python source code (.py) 
	can be compiled to different byte code also like IronPython (.Net) or Jython (JVM). 
	There are multiple implementations of Python language.
